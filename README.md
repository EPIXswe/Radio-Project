# Radio Project

A school project created by me (Philip Segerfast) and my other three classmates [Anton Baric](https://github.com/AntonBaric), [Sebastian Wiberg](https://github.com/SebastianTheButler) and [Elias Rundqvist](https://github.com/yungnunogod).

## What was is about?
The task was to fulfill a number of user stories in any way we liked. They were all about fetching and displaying information retrieved from the [API of the Swedish Radio (Sveriges Radio API)](https://sverigesradio.se/api/documentation/v2/index.html). This included fetching channels, programs, episodes and data related to those entities, such as showing a tableau for a specific channel.
We were also expected to have a login/register feature along with saving personal favourite programs and episodes.
A search function for programs is available too.
